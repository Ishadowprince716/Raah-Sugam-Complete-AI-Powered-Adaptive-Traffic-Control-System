## Demo Scenario: Polytechnic Roundabout Traffic Control

### Phase 1: Normal Traffic Operations (0-5 minutes)

**Objective**: Demonstrate normal adaptive traffic control

1. **Open the main dashboard** at http://localhost:3000

2. **Observe the intersection view**:
   - Five-way intersection visualization
   - Real-time vehicle counts per approach
   - Current signal phase and countdown timer
   - Live traffic flow animation

3. **Monitor AI decision-making**:
   - Watch the RL controller adjust signal timing
   - Observe queue length changes affecting decisions
   - Note the confidence scores for RL decisions

4. **Key metrics to observe**:
   - **Vehicle Detection**: 15-25 vehicles detected per approach
   - **Detection Latency**: <300ms average processing time
   - **Signal Adaptation**: Dynamic green time extensions based on queue lengths
   - **Controller Mode**: "Auto" (RL-based) with >70% confidence

**Expected Results**:
- Smooth traffic flow with adaptive signal timing
- Reduced wait times compared to fixed-timer baseline
- Real-time telemetry updates every 1-2 seconds

### Phase 2: Controller Mode Switching (5-8 minutes)

**Objective**: Demonstrate fallback controller capabilities

1. **Switch to Heuristic Mode**:
   - Click "Control Mode" panel on dashboard
   - Select "Heuristic" mode
   - Observe immediate transition to max-pressure algorithm

2. **Compare controller behaviors**:
   - **Auto Mode**: ML-based decisions with learning
   - **Heuristic Mode**: Rule-based max-pressure control
   - **Fixed Mode**: Traditional timer-based signals

3. **Test Manual Override**:
   - Switch to "Manual" mode
   - Select specific signal phase
   - Set custom green time duration
   - Observe immediate signal change

**Expected Results**:
- Seamless controller transitions without traffic disruption
- Different optimization strategies visible in traffic flow
- Manual control demonstrates operator override capability

### Phase 3: Emergency Vehicle Preemption (8-12 minutes)

**Objective**: Demonstrate emergency vehicle priority system

1. **Simulate Emergency Vehicle**:
   - The demo video includes simulated ambulance detection
   - Watch for emergency alert banner at top of dashboard
   - Observe automatic signal preemption

2. **Emergency Response Sequence**:
   - **Detection**: Red alert banner appears
   - **Preemption**: Immediate green wave for emergency approach
   - **Clearance**: Other approaches receive all-red signal
   - **Recovery**: Gradual return to normal operations

3. **Monitor Emergency Metrics**:
   - **Detection Accuracy**: >95% emergency vehicle recognition
   - **Response Time**: <2 seconds from detection to signal change
   - **Clearance Time**: 25-30 seconds emergency green wave
   - **Recovery Time**: 15-20 seconds return to normal flow

**Expected Results**:
- Instant emergency vehicle priority
- Clear visual and auditory alerts
- Automatic documentation in event log
- Quick recovery to normal operations

### Phase 4: Analytics and Performance (12-15 minutes)

**Objective**: Demonstrate system analytics and monitoring

1. **Navigate to Analytics Section**:
   - Click "Analytics" in dashboard navigation
   - View historical traffic patterns
   - Examine performance metrics

2. **Key Performance Indicators**:
   - **Traffic Throughput**: Vehicles processed per minute
   - **Average Wait Time**: Reduction vs. baseline
   - **Queue Efficiency**: Queue length optimization
   - **System Uptime**: 99.5%+ availability

3. **Open Grafana Monitoring**:
   - Visit http://localhost:3001
   - Login with admin/admin
   - View "Traffic Overview" dashboard

4. **System Health Metrics**:
   - API response times
